The following data was calculated using a constant acceleration for an object dropped from 200 meters.
Only the first 6 are shown.
1     200
2     195.1
3     180.4
4     155.9
5     121.6
6     77.5
7     23.6

These calculations were made with the following equations
a = 9.8 m/s²
v = at
d = hi - (1/2 at²)
d = hi - (vt + 1/2 at²)

We used the following values:
Initial Velocity = 0 m/s
Iterations       = 6
Acceleration   = 9.8 m/s²
Initial Height   = 200 m
